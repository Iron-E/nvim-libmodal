|libmodal| is a Neovim library/|plugin| aimed at simplifying the creation
of new "modes" (e.g. |Insert|, |Normal|). The entrance of modes is
creator-defined, and their exit defaults to <Esc>. The use and name of
modes is also creator-defined, and is outlined in |libmodal-usage|.

See: |vim-modes|

2. Usage                                   *libmodal-usage*

The |libmodal| interface is designed completely in |Lua|. It is incompatable
with Vimscript until Neovim 0.5 releases (as
https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/11306 will merge). Because of this
timed incompatability, the following must be done:

1. Define a |Lua| interface for your mode.
2. Use |lua-require| as a |user-command|.
	* See |lua-require-example| for information about how to do this.

`nvim-tabmode` is a plugin that was written to specifically display how to do
this. See below for a link to the repository where the source code may be
viewed.

See: |api|, |libmodal-lua|, |lua-api|, https://github.com/Iron-E/nvim-tabmode

Functions ~
                                                            *libmodal-mode-enter*

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% TODO continue here %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

|libmodal#Enter| takes three parameters. These parameters are not formally named
by the editor (as |libmodal#Enter| is declared `libmodal#Enter(`|...|`)` ).
However, the names of these parameters will be used throughout the document to
describe the index of the parameter (see |E740|).

Arg            Index Use
---            ----- ---
`modeName`       0     The name for the mode when prompting the user.
`modeCallback`   1     The function used to control the mode.
`modeCombos`     1     A dictionary of |libmodal-key-combinations|.
`supressExit`    2     A flag to enable |libmodal-exit-supression|.

- NOTE: either `modeCallback` OR `modeCombos` may be specified, not both.

                                                           *libmodal#Prompt*

|libmodal#Prompt| takes two parameters. These parameters are not formally named
by the editor (as |libmodal#Prompt| is declared `libmodal#Prompt(`|...|`)` ).
However, the names of these parameters will be used throughout the document to
describe the index of the parameter (see |E740|).

Arg            Index Use
---            ----- ---
`modeName`     0     The name for the mode when prompting the user.
`modeCallback` 1     The function used to control the mode.
`modeCommands` 1     A dictionary of commands→strings to execute.
`commandList`  2     A list of the commands in a `modeCallback`.

- NOTE: either `modeCallback` OR `modeCommands` may be specified, not both.
- NOTE: `commandList` is an optional parameter.
        - It is used as a completion source for when `modeCallback` is
		  specified.
        - Additionally, `commandList` is IGNORED when `modeCommands` is
		  specified since completions can be created from the dictionary keys.
        - If `commandList` is not specified when `modeCallback` is, no
		  completions will be provided for the prompt.


Receiving Input ~
                                                  *libmodal-receiving-input*

When mode creators call |libmodal#Enter| or |libmodal#Prompt|, the
`modeName` parameter is used to generate a unique |global-variable| for the
specific purpose of receiving said input. The |variable| is generated as
follows:

>
	let g:{tolower(a:modeName)}ModeInput = …
<

For example, if `modeName` is 'FOO', then the |variable| that is created is
`g:fooModeInput`.

Creating Modes ~
                                                   *libmodal-creating-modes*

For an example of a plugin that uses |libmodal|, see
https://github.com/Iron-E/vim-tabmode.

To define a new mode, you must first create a |user-function| to pass into
|libmodal#Enter|. Example:

>
	function! s:FooMode()
		if g:fooModeInput ==# "a"
			execute 'tabnew'
		elseif g:fooModeInput ==# "d"
			execute 'tabclose'
		endif
	endfunction
<

After defining said |user-function|, you can create a |mapping| to enter the
mode.

>
	command! FooModeEnter call libmodal#Enter('FOO', funcref('s:FooMode'))
	nnoremap <leader>n :FooModeEnter
<

- NOTE: the |funcref()| call must be there or else |libmodal#Enter| won't
        execute properly.

                                                 *libmodal-key-combinations*

While normally |libmodal| dictates that a mode creator should define their own
|user-function| for controlling a mode, there is a way to specify key
combinations.  If the second argument is set to a `modeCombos` |Dictionary|,
|libmodal#Enter| will automatically detect the |call|er's intent and pass control
over to an auxilliary function built to handle pre-defined combos.

- NOTE: When providing `modeCombos`, one no longer has to receive input for
        themselves. Despite this, the unique |variable| (see
		|libmodal-receiving-input|) is still updated, and you can create a
        listener for it just like for any other |variable|.

- NOTE: |libmodal-exit-supression| is still compatable with defining key
        combinations.

Here is an example that shows how to create a |Dictionary| that defines the
following actions:

Combo Action
----- ------
`zfo` Echo a message saying "It works!"
`zfc` Create a new tab.

>
	let s:barModeCombos = {
	\	'zfo': 'echom "It works!"',
	\	'zfc': 'tabnew'
	\}
<

- NOTE: When defining actions that involve a chorded keypress (e.g. |CTRL-W_s|),
        mode creators should use |i_CTRL-V| to insert the literal of that
        character.
        - For example, if a mode creator wants a mapping for `<C-s>v`, then it
          should be specified as `v`.

And then to enter that mode, you can call:

>
	call libmodal#Enter('BAR', s:barModeCombos)
<

|libmodal|'s internal processing of that |Dictionary| becomes more useful the
larger the |Dictionary| is. Internally, `s:barModeCombos` is rendered into a
|Dictionary| that looks like this:

>
	let s:barModeCombosInternal = {
	\	'z': {
	\		'f': {
	\			'c': 'echom "It works!"',
	\			'o': 'tabnew'
	\		}
	\	}
	\}
<

This allows |libmodal| to quickly determine which |map|pings are and are not
part of the mode. Because of this method, modes with |map|pings that have
similar beginnings are more efficient, and modes with more mappings get more
benefit from the quick tree-like traversal.

- NOTE: |libmodal#Enter| will only parse a `modeCombos` dict once upon
        entrance.
        - Changes to the mapping dictionary that may occur while in a mode
          are not reflected until the mode is entered again and the dictionary
          is re-parsed.

                                                         *libmodal-timeouts*

When |libmodal-key-combinations| are being used, mode creators may also enable
the use of Vim's built-in |timeout| feature. Unlike other options which are
specified by passing arguments to |libmodal#Enter|, this feature is enabled
through a |variable|.

- NOTE: If two keybinds share a beginning, and one is shorter than the other,
        (e.g. `zf` and `zfo`), then the user must press <CR> to execute it.
		This also means that commands ending in `` are not permitted.
        - Unfortunately, because of the limitations of Vimscript (more
          specifically |getchar()|) it is not possible to execute a function
          on |timeout| using |timers| exposed by the API. |getchar()| blocks
          execution and there is no combination of |sleep| or |wait()| that
          will allow |getchar()| to be called asynchronously
        - If you are reading this and know how to do something like this
          without using a secondary language, please let me know or open a
          pull request.

The reasoning for this is that the use of |timeout|s is primarily chosen by the
user of a mode, rather than the creator (whereas other features like
|libmodal-exit-supression| are largely creator-oriented).

To enable |timeout|s, one may set the following |variables|:

>
	" Set libmodal modes to turn timeouts on.
	let g:libmodalTimeouts = 1
	" Enable timeouts for specific mode.
	let g:{modeName}ModeTimeout = 1
<

Similarly, to disable them, one may set them to `0`.

- NOTE: If not specified by the user, `g:libmodalTimeouts` automatically
        references the |timeout| on/off value.
- NOTE: The `g:limbodalTimeouts` variable should NOT be defined by plugins.
        - Allow users to decide whether or not they want timeouts to be
          enabled globally by themselves.
- NOTE: Mode-specific timeout variables will override `g:libmodalTimeouts`.
        - This is so a default may be set but overridden.

When enabled, |libmodal-timeouts| will reference the mode user's |timeoutlen|
as specified in their |config|. This way, modes will feel consistent to users
by default.

However, mode creators may change |timeoutlen| upon entrance of a mode, and
then reset it upon exit. Example:

>
	function! s:BarMode() abort
		" Get the user's preferred timeout length.
		let l:timeoutlen = &timeoutlen
		" Set it to something else, like 1500ms
		let &timeoutlen = 1500
		" Enter a mode
		call libmodal#Enter(…)
		" Reset the timeout
		let &timeoutlen = l:timeoutlen
	endfunction
<

Mode creators who use `modeCallback`s may define timeouts manually using
|timers|, which is how |libmodal| implements them internally.

                                                  *libmodal-exit-supression*

When the `supressExit` parameter is specified, |libmodal#Enter| will ignore
<Esc> presses and instead listen for changes to a unique |variable| created
for the specific purpose of exiting the mode. The |variable| is generated as
follows:

>
	let g:{tolower(a:modeName)}ModeExit = 0
<

When this |variable| becomes set to `1`, the mode will exit the next time that
the `modeCallback` |user-function| |return|s.

Creating Prompts ~
                                                 *libmodal-creating-prompts*

Besides accepting user input like keys in |Normal-mode|, |libmodal| is also
capable of prompting the user for |input| like |Cmdline-mode|. To define a
|Cmdline-mode|-like prompt, use |libmodal#Prompt| rather than |libmodal#Enter|.

When `modeCommands` is specified, completions are provided the |keys| in
the |Dictionary| (see |command-completion-customlist|). See an example of this
below:

>
	let s:barModeCommands = {
	\	'new': 'tabnew',
	\	'close': 'tabclose',
	\	'last': 'tablast'
	\}
<

When `modeCallback` is specified, completions must be provided separately.
An equivalent to the above using a `modeCallback` would be:

>
	" Define callback
	function! s:BarMode() abort
		if g:barModeInput ==# 'new'
			execute 'tabnew'
		elseif g:barModeInput ==# 'close'
			execute 'tabclose'
		elseif g:barModeInput ==# 'last'
			execute 'tablast'
		endif
	endfunction

	" Define completion list
	let s:barModeCommandList = ['new', 'close', 'last']
<

You can then enter the mode using one of the following commands (depending on
whether or not you used a |Dictionary| or a callback):

>
	" Command dict
	call libmodal#Prompt('BAR', s:barModeCommands)
	" Callback + completion list
	call libmodal#Prompt('BAR', funcref('s:BarMode'), s:barModeCommandList)
<

- NOTE: if you want to create commands with arguments, you will need to
        use a callback.

Submodes ~
                                                         *libmodal-submodes*

|libmodal| has built-in support for entering additional modes while already in
a |libmodal| mode. To enter another mode, one must only call |libmodal#Enter|
(or |libmodal#Prompt|) from within a mode. Additionally, when a user presses
<Esc> they will automatically be taken back to the mode that they were
previously inside of (unless |libmodal-exit-supression| is used).

To test out this feature, one may run the following:

>
	let s:recurse = 0

	function! s:BarMode()
		if g:bar{s:recurse}ModeInput ==# 'z'
			let s:recurse += 1
			execute 'BarModeEnter'
			let s:recurse -= 1
		endif
	endfunction

	let l:func = funcref('s:BarMode')
	command! BarModeEnter call libmodal#Enter('BAR' . s:recurse, l:func)
	execute 'BarModeEnter'
<

This triggers |libmodal#Enter| every time the user inputs the "z" key. While
this example only uses one `modeCallback`, it is possible to use as many
submodes as Vim's call-stack can handle (i.e. a lot).

4. Configuration                           *libmodal-configuration*

The following |highlight-groups| can be |config|ured to change a mode's |color|s:

Name              Default      Description
----              -------      -----------
`LibmodalPrompt`  `ModeMsg`    Color for the mode text.
`LibmodalStar`    `StatusLine` Color for the `*` at the beginning.
